# Matlab development
1. Detect if there is movement or not:
We extract the mean, standard deviation and variance from sections of data. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=In_f4mwDnzk <br/>
"one_movement_detection" file (inside matlab folder) detects the part where there is movement when the data is divided in sections and there is only one movement. <br/>
Just need to load the data called "one_movement_detection_data.mat" and run the script.
